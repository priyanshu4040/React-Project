‚úÖ What is React Fiber?
React Fiber is the new rendering engine introduced in React 16. It is a complete reimplementation of the React core algorithm, designed to make React faster and more flexible.



‚úÖ Why React Fiber?
Before Fiber, React used a synchronous rendering process called the Stack Reconciler.

In this old approach, React processed updates in one go, blocking the main thread until the entire update was complete.

This caused issues like laggy UI and unresponsive apps, especially for complex components.

React Fiber solves this problem by introducing:

Incremental Rendering: Breaks rendering work into smaller units called fibers, allowing React to pause and resume work.

Priority-Based Updates: Assigns priority levels to different tasks, so React can handle urgent updates first (e.g., user input) and defer less important updates (e.g., background data fetching).

Concurrency: Allows React to work on multiple tasks simultaneously, improving responsiveness.



‚úÖ How Does React Fiber Work?
React Fiber splits the rendering process into two phases:

Reconciliation Phase (Render Phase):

React analyzes what needs to be updated and builds a virtual representation of the UI.

This phase is interruptible, meaning React can pause and resume it, allowing higher-priority tasks to run first.

Commit Phase:

React updates the DOM with the changes determined in the previous phase.

This phase is synchronous (executes all changes at once).



‚úÖ Example in Real Life:
Imagine you are watching a movie and a friend sends you a text.

In the old React, you would pause the movie, respond to the text, then resume the movie.

In React Fiber, you can respond to the text without pausing the movie, keeping both tasks running smoothly.



‚úÖ Benefits of React Fiber:

Smooth User Experience:

Updates are broken into small chunks, preventing the UI from freezing.

Priority Management:

Urgent updates (e.g., user clicks) are processed before less important ones (e.g., background data fetching).

Error Handling:

Fiber introduces better error boundaries, allowing React to recover from errors without crashing the entire app.



‚úÖ Summary:
React Fiber is a complete rewrite of React‚Äôs rendering engine, designed for better performance and responsiveness.

It allows React to pause, resume, and prioritize rendering tasks, making apps faster and smoother.
